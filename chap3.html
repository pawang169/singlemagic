I head up to my room. I cannot believe life. It springs unexpected boosts on you, which happen to ruin you some more. I go in my room to see a shadowy figure looking at my things.  &ldquo; who is there show yourself! &ldquo; I say &ldquo; Oh, Ferny do you not remember me? Oh, my sweetie I am your uncle eddy! &ldquo; I had learned not to trust anyone, but for some reason I felt he was telling the truth. &ldquo; really, oh I missed you so much &ldquo; I said. I hugged him and I did not leave him for something like 3 minutes. &ldquo; oh, Fern you have grown SO much! Oh, uh Fern I’m slightly hungry would you mind if I…&ldquo; &ldquo; help yourself! &ldquo; I say. OH I almost forgot about Raymie &ldquo; uncle I think I have to go get a friend, her parents were just killed so she might stay with us for a while. &ldquo; uncle frowns and nods as I leave I notice an old suitcase which must be uncle &lsquo;s. &ldquo; Raymie come on. Let’s go &ldquo; Raymie follows me hesitant about who and what to trust and I understand it is a terrible feeling. As soon as Raymie see &lsquo;s uncle, she shrieks &ldquo; No I will not go there. Your uncle he took my wonderful parents from the world- here look! &ldquo; Raymie shows me some pictures that look like uncles. 
All evidence she has proven my uncle is the one, but I as a niece refuse to believe that. And I would later find that indeed Raymie was right that moment would be a lot sooner than wanted. &ldquo; Fern let us leave no come on! &ldquo; she said, but I cannot move I am so stricken, how could uncle- the same uncle who use to do puppet shows for me and my friends kill my closest friend &ldsquo;s parents?
I hear a screech and Raymie slides in front of me. BAAM I here and then uncle and all signs of him are gone. Ma and my sisters come in at just that moment and Ma decides to confront me first. She knows today has been hard on me, but she does not know it has been the worst. &ldquo; Ferry liste… Raymie oh my fairies Raymie needs rest and Fern leave I need to do stuff with her. &ldquo; I straight out refuse after I know what she did to my parents it feels hard to trust her. But I guess my heart overpowers my mind so I leave and three minutes later when I go back up Raymie is getting up. And ma is going on about how Raymie room has been set up next to mine. Maybe my foster mother is not so bad after all. I decide I am going to think the rest of the day over tomorrow.
