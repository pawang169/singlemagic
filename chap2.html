<center><h1> Chapter 2 </h1></center>
&ldquo;YOU WHAT?&ldquo; I ask. Ma just told me that she was part of my parent&lsquo;s murder and I&lsquo;m taking this as well as I can! &ldquo;Oh, sweetie It was not what I wanted to do, and I am so very sorry!&ldquo; she says. &ldquo;Ma, I trusted you I loved you, how could you?&ldquo; says Fern tears flowing down her angry face. &ldquo;That is, it I do not want to stay here for a second more!&ldquo; And Fern Storms out of the house. 
As Air brushes her face Fern thinks about everything her mom just told her. She could not believe it, the woman who she had called Ma almost her entire life was now acting like a jerk! No, she WAS a Jerk!  As Fern was thinking, she realized it was very late and wanted to go back home. &ldquo;No fern you have to let Ma suffer a little stay out or… go to Raymie&lsquo;s house!&ldquo; The idea was perfect Raymie, Ferns best Friend was always welcoming and understanding. So, fern headed towards Raymie&lsquo;s home and upon reaching Fern saw something that nauseated her slightly. &ldquo;Raymie come outside please tell me you are not de…dea…dead&ldquo; It was hard for Raymie to say it, but it sure looked that way. There was blood on the window and the window was cracked. &ldquo;No, No, no, no, no, noooooo&ldquo; Fern refused to believe her only friend was gone. So, she hit herself and forced herself to enter the home. 
&lsquo;Raymie</pre> come here I need you!&ldquo; Fern ran up to Raymie&lsquo;s room to find her her sitting on the bed. Fern breathes a sigh of relief and says &ldquo;Hey Raymie what happened her your home is a mess!&ldquo; &ldquo;Ferny oh I mana and dad are… they…” Fern understands and can not look at her friend anymore. Her heart is full of anger and detest for her fake mother. I hush Raymie and pick her up. I know who we must talk to, and I know that She will regret it! We slowly walk to my home, both depressed. And as soon as we reach home, I realize no one is at home! I step inside &ldquo;Raymie please stay here, I want to make sure it is safe inside!&ldquo;  I tell her. And I walk up to my room.
