"I am older than you Lavender so I am better!
"Oh really Rose, you're older than me by barely 15 seconds" ugh my sister Rose and Lavender never stop fighting over who is better than the other! It is soo annoying like seriously they share a room and once i woke up at around 3 in the morning to get water and echo's of their voice could still be heard!
Ma says it is just a phase but I know better! I have been with them my ENTIRE life while ma, only 5 years!Well we are adopted! my parents both died when I was quite young! 6 to be exact, my sisters were both 9! the lights just went off and when they came back on, my parents had been well destroyed! The police know it was a murder,but by who- it's still a mystery. I love my Ma and Pa soo much if i loved 
Mom and dad 100% and more i love my new parents 99% at least! Ma's name is Mandy and pa's name is George. A little more about me is that my sisters have magical powers they do not know what their powers are nor how to use them, they tend to imagine what their powers are and fight over who would have the strongest power, they can litteraly fight for ANYTHING!
Ma says i too have magicin my veins,but i am even more clueless than my sisters. I do not know if magic will ever show it's self,but i know my family will always be close to me and NOTHING could be more magical than that.
Family decides how they want you to live- happily or sadly, and they have evry power to make it that way. 
OMG the bickering has started for the upteenth time!"Oh Rose and you too Lavender would you mind shutting you big mouths already!? If you meant to give me a headache you did a very good job of it and listen i am sick of you're endless bickering why can;t you get along properly yet?" i ask and all the anger i have been suppressingjust brings it's self to the world! but even after those 2 can't shut up! "Maaa my head really hurts!"
I yell "oh honey why don't you go right up to the bathroom, i'll be right there with some asprin and cream." ma saays "ok maa" i head up to the bathroom while my head continuously throbbs! i look at myself in the mirror, and look twice "aaaaaah ma i'm glowing! help!" I litteraly am glowing and it is really scary- Maa rushes up, and smiles,"my sweetheart's becoming a BIG girl aren't you?" maa whispers "your powers have emerged darling" she says.
"WHAT" i yell how is it possible to have my powers emerged before Rose and Lavender's? "What are you guy's yelling abou... Fern sweetie are you ok?" lavender asks "I am just fine thankyou!" I  yell "Hey hey hey hey tell me everything." Rose hugs me and whisper's. Ma takes a deep breath looking as if she just ate a slug soup! "I..I... I think we have to call a girls meeting" she says using the term we call for really important depressing matters. 
But why I wonder why Ma looked happy about all of this just a minute ago. "Is everything ok ma?" Ma shakes her head no "i'm afraid not and i really hope you forgive me for this." I didn't think it was possible to my head hurt more than already, but as we were walking to the kitchen table my head was spinning so hard it felt like it was about to fall off. "Fern this will be hardest on you and i want you take this as well you can" 
â€œMA just tell me it can't be that bad!" What i say seem to beak it for ma she starts to weep really hard "ma i am sorry for whatever it is that i said, but i need you to talk you are scaring me!" i say and she talks it just makes me more upset!
